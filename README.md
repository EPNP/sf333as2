- Player X is controlled by the computer. The computer follows the following rules for gameplay:
- (a) If there is a winning move available, the computer should place its mark in that position.
- (b) If there is no winning move for the computer but the opponent player O has a potential winning move in the next turn, the computer should place its mark to block the opponent.
- (c) If there are no immediate winning or blocking moves, the computer should place its mark in the center.
- (d) If none of the above conditions apply, the computer should place its mark randomly in an available spot.

When the game is restarted, players take turns starting with player O and then the computer X.
